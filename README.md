The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal and the second is the project implementation 

The Project is intended to classify the images to identify invasive species help save environment and ecosystem.

The project will save time, cost of researchers who search intesively for long times to identify the invasive species to safeguard habitat.

The Project makes use of Deep Neural Networks, Tranfer Learning
The project is part of a kaggle competition
